### Update/Context
Following the last blog, I have progressed even more in my Freedom Project. I created multiple wireframes for my Freedom Project. Subsequently, I started the coding portion with my peer, Jimmy, and worked to design a minimal viable product.
### Constructing a MVP for my Freedom Project
Starting the process for building a Travel webpage, my peer and I split the coding sections into various responsibilities. Through our planning, we both split the CSS into two, and I focused on the cards, whereas Jimmy placed more emphasis on the Navbar design.

I first imported CDN links from Bootstrap - CSS and Javascript - and started working on the basic portion of the webpage next. As for the overview, I created a `section` element, followed with `div` including a container, row, and column class. Inside the `div` with the column class, I added a `p` and `h1` element to create a title and mini-context. Afterwards, I moved into making the cards. I wanted the display cards to be both informative and good-looking. So, as I imported the codes for them on Bootstrap, I changed all of the placeholder text, using a prep document made earlier in the year, and fit all of the software and hardware innovations information in it.

A challenge, however, that came along was the size proportions. Since some cards had more information than the others, the height differences were prominent.

<!--
 my initial move was to delete the `style` inline that placed a set-width.>
