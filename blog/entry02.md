#### Researching Software & Hardware
After choosing my topic, Transportation/Travel for the Freedom Project, I started to research software and hardware technologies that were correlated with my field. I began looking for software technologies first. I started by typing "Transportation and Travel software" into the Google Searchbar, and I searched for results as I entered my phrase. The first website that caught my attention was ["G2.com"](https://www.g2.com/categories/travel-management).
