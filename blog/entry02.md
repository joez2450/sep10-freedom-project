#### Researching 
##### Software
After choosing my topic, Transportation/Travel for the Freedom Project, I started to research software and hardware technologies that were correlated with my field. I began looking for software technologies first. I started by typing "Transportation and Travel software" into the Google Searchbar, and I looked for results as I entered my phrase. The first website that caught my attention was ["G2.com"](https://www.g2.com/categories/travel-management). In the website, there were many Travel Management software apps that were ranked and rated based on their features and aspects. I looked over most of the apps, and I was impressed by most of the softwares. The first software app that impressed me was [Navan](https://navan.com/). The Navan app was accessible to all platforms, supported a variety of languages, and had features that included the calculations of desired trip costs, costs at destinations places, and a database of ones history spending on transportation. The second software app that impressed me was [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/). In the TravelPerk app, there were travel alerts (provides warning of specific travel conditions), a section for check-in information for trips (subways, airport, etc), 24/7 customer support with real agents, and there is a section for flexible trip sections. The third software app that impressed me was [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/). With the SAP Concur app, there was a budget system, which helps with decision making for trips, a report system, and easy to create plans.
