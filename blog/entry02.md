#### Researching 
##### Software
After choosing my topic, Transportation/Travel for the Freedom Project, I started to research software and hardware technologies that were correlated with my field. I began looking for software technologies first. I started by typing "Transportation and Travel software" into the Google Searchbar, and I looked for results as I entered my phrase. The first website that caught my attention was ["G2.com"](https://www.g2.com/categories/travel-management). In the website, there were many Travel Management software apps that were ranked and rated based on their features and aspects. I looked over most of the apps, and I was impressed by various softwares. The first software app that impressed me was [Navan](https://navan.com/). The Navan app is accessible to all platforms, supported a variety of languages, and had features that included the calculations of desired trip costs, costs at destinations places, and a database of ones history spending on transportation. The second software app that impressed me was [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/). In the TravelPerk app, there were travel alerts (provides warning of specific travel conditions, i.e storms, weathers, crime alert etc), a section for check-in information for trips (subways, airport, etc), 24/7 customer support with real agents, and there is a section for flexible trip sections. The third software app that impressed me was [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/). With the SAP Concur app, there was a budget system, which helps with decision making for trips, a report system, and easy to create plans. 

##### Hardware
Upon researching the software technologies that were correlated with Transportation/Travel, I also researched hardware technologies. I began off by typing "Transportation and Travel Hardware Technology" in Google. As I looked through the results of my search, I stumbled across [PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html) In the website, I saw many hardware technologies that were useful for Travel. I looked through all of the hardwares, and similar to my software research, there were hardware technologies that also impressed me. The first hardware technology that impressed me was the [CrazyCap Self-Cleaning Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/CrazyCap-Pro-Award-Winning-Self-Cleaning-Insulated/dp/B0B4BSYSPZ/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2000726%2Ftravel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html&th=1) The CrazyCap Self-Cleaning Water Bottle gained my attention because it is was the first self-cleaning bottle I saw. The bottle itself was able to self-purify water in a short amount of time, has a self-cleaning feature, which allows the bottle to be stink free, provides a double wall vaccumed feature that keeps your drink cold or hot for a long period, and a built-in hydratation reminder that keeps you from being dehydrated. The second hardware technology that impressed me was [Solis Lite Portable Mobile Hotspot](https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Coverage-Connected-Devices-Technology/dp/B08YKB6VMN/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html). The Solis Lite Portable Mobile Hotspot also caught my attention because it is able to provide reliable WiFi in over 135 countries, allow 10 people to connect to a single WiFi, and guaranteed to work for 16 hours without charging. The third hardware technology that impressed me was [Rolling Sqaure inCharge 6 Portable Charger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/inCharge-Six-One-Portable-Compatible/dp/B086WHBN3N/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html)
