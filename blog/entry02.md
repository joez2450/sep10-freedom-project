### Update
After choosing my topic, Transportation/Travel for the Freedom Project in Blog 1, I started to go through a research process to find software and hardware technologies that were correlated with my field.

### Researching
#### Software
I started looking for software technologies first, typing "Transportation and Travel software" into the Google Search bar. The first website that caught my attention was [G2](https://www.g2.com/categories/travel-management). On the G2 website, many Travel Management software apps that were ranked and rated based on their features and aspects. I looked over most of the apps on the website, and I was impressed by various software. The first software app that impressed me was [Navan](https://navan.com/). The Navan app struck me because it is accessible to all platforms, and has features that include the calculations of aspired trip costs in full detail, prices at destination places, and a database of one's history of spending on transportation. The second software app that impressed me was [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/). In the TravelPerk app, there were travel alerts (provide warning of specific travel conditions, i.e weather, crime alert, etc), a section for check-in information for trips (subways, airport, etc), 24/7 customer support with real agents, and there is a section for flexible trip sections. The third software app that impressed me was [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/). With the SAP Concur app, there was a budget system, which helps with decision-making for trips, a reporting system, and easy-to-create plans. 

#### Hardware
Upon researching the software technologies that were correlated with Transportation/Travel, I also researched hardware technologies. I started by searching "Transportation and Travel Hardware Technology" on Google. As I looked through my search results, I stumbled across [PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html) On the website, I saw a list of hardware technologies that were useful for Travel. I looked through all of the hardware, and similar to my software research, there were hardware technologies that also impressed me. The first hardware technology that impressed me was the [CrazyCap Self-Cleaning Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/CrazyCap-Pro-Award-Winning-Self-Cleaning-Insulated/dp/B0B4BSYSPZ/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2000726%2Ftravel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html&th=1). The CrazyCap Self-Cleaning Water Bottle gained my attention because it was the first advanced self-cleaning bottle that I saw. The bottle itself can self-purify water in a short amount of time, has a self-cleaning feature that allows the bottle to be stink-free, provides a double wall vacuum feature, which keeps your drink cold or hot for a long period, and includes a built-in hydration reminder that keeps you from being dehydrated. The second hardware technology that impressed me was [Solis Lite Portable Mobile Hotspot](https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Coverage-Connected-Devices-Technology/dp/B08YKB6VMN/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html). The Solis Lite Portable Mobile Hotspot also caught my attention because it was the first type of portable WiFi that I saw with many desirable features. The portable hotspot can provide reliable WiFi in over 135 countries, allows 10 people to connect to a single WiFi, and is guaranteed to work for 16 hours without charging. The third hardware technology that impressed me was [Rolling Square inCharge 6 Portable Charger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/inCharge-Six-One-Portable-Compatible/dp/B086WHBN3N/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html). This hardware technology amazed me as it is such a small size, yet it provides a big function. The charger itself can charge any device (iPhone, Computer, etc), is made out of durable materials, and charge multiple devices at once. 

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the second stage of the EDP, which is to research my topic. I am still researching the past and current software and hardware technologies that are connected with my topic, Transportation/Travel. In the future when I am at stage 3, I will incorporate some of the information from the technologies into my other research to create a solution to my problem, travel safety. 

### Skills

#### Effective Researching
I learned the skill of Effective Researching throughout my research on Transportation/Travel software and hardware. Sometimes I would not find my desired outcomes, whenever I searched things with statements including "Travel Software" and "Transportation Hardware". As a solution, I added words like "gadgets, technology, inventions, and tools" in my Google searches. I also added Transportation with Travel into my search bar, so there are more results in my field. With this strategy, I was able to find more results, and some of them were used for my project.

#### Skimming
Over the course of researching Travel software and hardware, I also learned the skill of skimming. Whenever I searched for something, there were millions of results that appeared. Obviously, there were a lot of options to choose from, however, I cannot look through all of them at once. To find the best source effectively, I skimmed through multiple websites until I found one that was both informative and helpful for my work. Through this method, I was able to conduct my research both effectively and quickly. 

#### Time Management
Time Management was an important skill I learned throughout the blog and research. At times, I would be stuck or spend too much time on a specific task, which slowed my progress down. To prevent the lack of productivity, I moved on to later tasks and completed them before coming back to the task that I spent and stood a long time on. Among this plan, I not only progressed but also saved time that I could have lost by staying in one place.
