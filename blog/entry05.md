### Update/Context
Since the last blog, I have achieved a margin of accomplishments in my Freedom Project. I tinkered with my selection of tools (Skeleton, A-Frame, and SASS) in various files by coding example templates. Based on my experimentations, I ended up choosing A-Frame as my permanent tool. Upon the decision, I had to familiarize myself of the engine.

### Tinkering
Beginning with my A-Frame tinkering process, I looked over the documentation provided by the software company. As I analyzed all of the concepts, the three main topics that interested me were importing 3D Models and Images, Physics and Collisions, and Video. But before I tested reached the subjects, I tested additional components for more context of how the tool functioned.

In my IDE, I began by importing the A-Frame CDN link for all of the features to work. I then pasted a skeleton base for A-Frame, which included the tags: `(html),(head),(body), and (a-scene)`. Afterwards, I placed the first primitives (shapes) into my VR scene using these lines of code: `<a-sphere position="10 2 0"></a-sphere> <a-box position="0 2 0"></a-box> <a-sphere
 position="-10 2 0"></a-sphere>`. The next element I used was `<a-plane>`. For this component I utilized the `rotation` property to make a platform. I added more touches using the `color` attribute, following with `scaling`.


 At last, I tested the
