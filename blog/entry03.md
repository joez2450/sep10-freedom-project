### Update/Context
Recently, I transitioned into Part A of the Freedom Project. In this stage, I organized all of the notes that I gathered throughout the Project. With a couple of days of organization, I quickly reached Part B: **Brainstorming Future Inventions** of the Project. There, I would generate ideas to solve my issue.

### Brainstorming Future Inventions
To begin with, brainstorming future inventions, my partner, Jimmy, and I looked over our organized notes, which included the products [WYND Air Purifier](https://hellowynd.com/products/essential?variant=44129312440593), [Rolling Square inCharge 6 Portable Charger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/inCharge-Six-One-Portable-Compatible/dp/B086WHBN3N/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html), [SIMO Solis Lite Portable Mobile Hotspot](https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Coverage-Connected-Devices-Technology/dp/B08YKB6VMN/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html), [CrazyCap Self Cleaning Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/CrazyCap-Pro-Award-Winning-Self-Cleaning-Insulated/dp/B0B4BSYSPZ/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2000726%2Ftravel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html&th=1), and apps including [Navan](Navan.com), [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/), and [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/). Upon review, I tried to incorporate all of the features in the softwares and hardwares into one bunch/invention.

The first idea I created with my partner was a "better app". The process for this plan revolved around our thinking of a new software. In this app, my peer and I decided to include many features that were both non-existent and co-existing and were beneficial for people in many ways. Based on our ideas, the app would include accurate time for scheduled transportation methods, active management (tracking, support, check-in information, etc), a section that provides the safety and alerts of an area (aqi, temperature, etc), and a feature where there are free movies and games when traveling. The app will also function in all places, while also providing parts of details without WiFi.

The second idea I created with my partner was a "condensed invention". The
concept behind the focus was that there were many aspects and properties all being compacted into one creation. With our thoughts, we wanted the invention to be meaningful and have a purpose for everyone. From this, we wanted to include a fan and air purifier on one side, charger plugs on another side, and a wireless WiFi (built-in). In addition, we also wanted the creation to be durable, long-lasting, and be used for a long time without being charged.

### EDP
Currently, I am still in the third stage of the Engineering Design Process: **Brainstorming Possible Solutions**. Though my partner and I already generated many inventions that reflect our main point, safety, and enjoyment, we are still thinking of new inventions and changes that we can make to our existing plans. In the future, when we move on to the fourth stage: **Plan the most promising solution**, we will decide out of all of our ideas to see which conceptions are the best in terms of efficiency and effectiveness to our solution.
