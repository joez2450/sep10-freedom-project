### Update/Context
Recently, I transitioned into Part A of the Freedom Project. In this stage, I organized all of the notes that I gathered throughout the project. With a couple of days of organization, I quickly reached Part B: **Brainstorming Future Inventions** of the project. There, I would generate ideas to solve my issue regarding travel.

### Brainstorming Future Inventions
To begin with, brainstorming future inventions, my partner, Jimmy, and I looked over our organized notes, which included the products [WYND Air Purifier](https://hellowynd.com/products/essential?variant=44129312440593), [Rolling Square inCharge 6 Portable Charger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/inCharge-Six-One-Portable-Compatible/dp/B086WHBN3N/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html), [SIMO Solis Lite Portable Mobile Hotspot](https://www.amazon.com/Hotspot-Coverage-Connected-Devices-Technology/dp/B08YKB6VMN/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000726/travel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html), [CrazyCap Self Cleaning Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/CrazyCap-Pro-Award-Winning-Self-Cleaning-Insulated/dp/B0B4BSYSPZ/?tag=pcworld02-20&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcworld.com%2Farticle%2F2000726%2Ftravel-gadgets-need-next-trip-or-vacation.html&th=1), and apps including [Navan](Navan.com), [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/), and [SAP Concur](https://www.concur.com/). Upon review, we tried to incorporate all of the features in the software and hardware into numerous inventions that were all compacted with features.

The first idea I created with my partner was a "better app". The process for this plan revolved around our thinking of a new software. In this app, my peer and I plan to include many features that were both non-existent and co-existing and were beneficial for people in many ways. Based on our ideas, the app would include accurate time for scheduled transportation methods, active management (tracking, support, check-in information, etc), a section that provides the safety and alerts of an area (AQI, temperature, etc), and a feature where there are free movies and games when traveling. The app will also function in all places while also providing parts of details without WiFi, allowing users to access parts of the app with no signal connection.

The second idea I created with my colleague was a "condensed invention". The concept behind the focus was that there were many aspects and properties all being compacted into one creation. We wanted the invention to be meaningful and have a purpose for everyone. With our thoughts, we plan to include a fan and air purifier on one side, charger plugs on another side, and a built-in wireless WiFi feature. Furthermore, we also wanted the creation to be durable, long-lasting, and be used for a long time without charging, so we plan to immerse the invention in a hard material while also adding features to make it constantly charge with sunlight. This way, the invention is more convenient and provides more reason for usage. This innovative idea will most likely be modeled.

The third idea I created with my peer was a "new transportation method". For this idea, we wanted to incorporate all of the known methods, land, and air, into one vehicle. The invention seems the most problematic, but it is also the most helpful one. In this creation, the vehicle would have motors and powerful engines to go at a fast pace in both the air and land. The vehicle will also be powered by electricity. This feature may seem odd as the vehicle's purpose is to partially function underwater, however, the transportation method will also be embedded with durable materials, that are both light and prevent water from reaching the core. In addition to this, the vehicle will also be reliable and work properly for a long time without having to constantly charge, making the creation super effective.



### EDP
Currently, I am still in the third stage of the Engineering Design Process: **Brainstorming Possible Solutions**. Though my partner and I already generated many inventions that reflect our main point, safety, and enjoyment, we are still thinking of new inventions and changes that we can make to our existing plans. In the future, when we move on to the fourth stage: **Plan the most promising solution**, we will decide out of all of our ideas to see which conceptions are the best in terms of efficiency and effectiveness to our solution.

### Skills
While brainstorming new solutions for my Freedom Project, I learned and incorporated three major skills that were important to me: Social Interaction, Organization, and Creativity.

#### Skill #1: Organization
Organization was the skill that most arguably played a big role during my transitions in the Freedom Project. When I first reached Part A, there was much travel software and hardware information (links, images, features of inventions, etc) that was spread out and unorganized in my notes. It was clear that arranging files was an important task, so I went through a stage of organization. For the duration of the point, I sorted the necessary details for each software and hardware multiple times. With the arrangement and organization I completed, my partner and I were both able to find the most useful sources, thus benefitting us as we reached Part B.


#### Skill #2: Social Interaction
Social Interaction was also an important skill that I both learned and incorporated during my shift in stages in the project. When I completed Part A and moved into Part B of the Freedom Project, I was required to generate possible solutions regarding my topic and focus. However, since I was also working as a pair, I was mandated to connect with my partner, Jimmy. Throughout most of the brainstorming process, communication was constantly being flowed between my partner and me. This allowed us to rapidly compact more ideas, as more design schemes were generated in a quick manner. From this, not only my interaction but also my connection skills vividly improved.

#### Skill #3: Creativity
Out of all the other skills, creativity was the most important that I took in and used during the stage of the project. As we were in the process of tinkering with new inventions, we were struggling. Generating the inventions was no easy task, it required creative thinking. My partner and I needed to think outside the box, while also being open-minded about the impacts our inventions would bring to the world. We went through many creative and considerate processes to help us compact ideas (new app, invention, and transit method). Upon all of the ideas we generated throughout time, not only did our creativity skills grow, but also our overall thinking (processing, etc) as well.
