## Choosing A Topic

I've decided to work on Transportation/Travel for the freedom project because I had a passion for this specific field since my childhood. I considered choosing Fitness or Restaurant, however I figured Transportation/Travel is the best fit as it makes me feel comfortable. Choosing these specific topics wasn't easy, it came with a lot of research. Before I even chose Transportation/Travel as my main topic, I researched the topic briefly. I looked over ["Five Ways Technology Will Change Transportation"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/12/22/five-ways-technology-will-change-transportation-in-2022/?sh=3e98c0de20d8) by Forbes, and ["Why Transportation Matters in Everyday Life"](https://scnafrica.com/2022/03/23/why-transportation-matters-in-everyday-life/) by SCN Africa. Both of these websites were informative, and it provided me with an idea of how the Transportation industry works and grows throughout the years. But the article that caught my attention was ["Impacts of transportation network companies on urban mobility"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00678-z). Seeing this specific article explaining how impactful transportation is to society makes me more determined to work on this topic. 

## Engineering Design Process

I am currently defining a problem in Transportation (first stage of EDP). The problem I wish to solve with my freedom project is **raising the awareness of the impact of transportation**. After this, I have to research the problem thoroughly by looking at various informative websites, and communicating with other peers who will be working with me in this project.
