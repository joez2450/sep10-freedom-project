## Choosing A Topic

I've decided to work on Transportation/Travel for the Freedom Project because I had a passion for this specific field since my childhood. I considered choosing Fitness or Restaurant, however, I figured Transportation/Travel is the best fit as it makes me feel the most comfortable. Choosing these specific topics wasn't easy, it came with a lot of research. Before I even chose Transportation/Travel as my main topic, I researched the topic briefly. I looked over ["Five Ways Technology Will Change Transportation"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/12/22/five-ways-technology-will-change-transportation-in-2022/?sh=3e98c0de20d8) by Forbes, and ["Why Transportation Matters in Everyday Life"](https://scnafrica.com/2022/03/23/why-transportation-matters-in-everyday-life/) by SCN Africa. Both of these websites were informative, and they provided me with an idea of how the Transportation industry works and grows throughout the years. But, the article that caught my attention was ["How Transportation Technologies Will Change Everything"](https://www.govtech.com/transportation/how-transportation-technologies-will-change-everything-.html) by Government Technology. Seeing this specific article explaining how impactful transportation is to society makes me more determined to work on this topic. 

## Engineering Design Process

As of now, I am defining a problem in transportation (the first stage of EDP). The problem I wish to solve with my Freedom Project is **improving the safety of transportation**. With this in mind, I have to research the problem thoroughly by looking at various informative websites and communicating with other peers who will be working with me on this project. 

## Skills
One skill I learned while working on this blog is Effective Googling. During this task, a lot of googling was required. To gather important information efficiently, I had to think of ways to get better search results. I added words like "technology, impact, everyday life, and change" in my searches. From this method, I was quickly able to gather the information I needed regarding transportation.

Another skill I learned is Organization. A lot of organization was also required during this blog. Before choosing my main topic, I gathered many links to websites regarding my list of topics to see which field was the best for me. To know which link provided what information, I had to learn to organize the links into multiple sections. With organized links, it saved me time to access specific websites for my topic.

The third skill I learned is Time Management. When I was first researching and thinking about which topics to choose, I spent too much time analyzing multiple topics. Instead, I focused on one topic at a time, and there, I would find the information that I needed to choose each topic. This strategy also saved me time because I was able to progress rather than being stuck in one single place for a long time. 

## Summary
I am eager to make a website that is focusing on Transportation/Travel. My passion for this field started when I was a child. I was amazed to see all of the innovations in Transportation/Travel.
