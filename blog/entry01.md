## Choosing A Topic

I've decided to work on Transportation/Travel for the freedom project because I had a passion for this specific field since my childhood. I considered choosing Fitness or Restaurant, however I figured Transportation/Travel is the best fit as it makes me feel comfortable. Choosing these specific topics wasn't easy, it came with a lot of research. Before I even chose Transportation/Travel as my main topic, I researched the topic briefly. I looked over ["Five Ways Technology Will Change Transportation"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/12/22/five-ways-technology-will-change-transportation-in-2022/?sh=3e98c0de20d8) by Forbes.
