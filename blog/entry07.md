### Update/Context

Since the last blog, I created presentation slides with my peer, Jimmy, to demonstrate to the class the overall process of my Freedom Project. I further presented my webpage, which was in the Beyond MVP stage, to the class. By doing so, I learned takeaways from my experience.

### Takeaways

#### Expo Showcase

* Management

During the presentation duration time, many people moved around the cafeteria and looked at various web pages. At some point, there were multiple visitors at my designated table who wished to view projects. One after the other, more people came. Jimmy and I were overwhelmed since various people wanted presentations in a short amount of time. As a result, my peer and I learned to have everything set up after each presentation, so we could be prepared as soon as possible and reduce stress.

#### In-class Presentation

* Organization

Given that I was working with a partner for my Freedom Project, it was easy to get lost. Having two people work on a singular task placed us in a spot where not every action was known. Jimmy and I would usually take different paths, especially during our learning process. Organization was a necessary skill to have. My peer and I learned to be neat with our notes to make life easier when it was time to create a product. Indeed, during our construction process, we communicated to develop a prototype, and it was not as difficult, since everything was already arranged for us.

* Strategic Formatting

As for my [SEP Presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y_WxQUBVwVSWlmgBhd8s24UOm_IPpfGh-H2BJjkCRk4/edit), my peer and I added a final question to conclude our showcase. However, the main problem that occurred was the question “What is your ideal vacation?” was broad and not fit for ending a demonstration. It was more suitable for a hook or in other words the start of the presentation. Because of this, learning to be more strategic in formatting is important given that the way a presentation is set-up leaves the audience off with a certain impression.
### EDP

As for the Engineering Design Process, I am on the eighth and last stage: Communicating the results. I have already designed an MVP and added additional features to further improve my [webpage](https://jimmyl6413.github.io/sep10-freedom-project/). Now, I reached the stage to present and share my year-long work that I collaborated with Jimmy to others.


### Skills
As I delivered my presentation alongside my peer in both the class and the Expo-Showcase, I learned to enhance my skills of organization, management, and strategicness as they were my main takeaways.

I had to become more strategic and decisive when making presentations and the format in which it is lay out. Additionally, I began to be more organized along with managing the circumstances I am in to minizing any conflicts that may emerge.
