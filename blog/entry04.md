### Context

After spending time finishing Part A and B of the Freedom Project in the past few weeks, I reached a new stage - to choose a tool that I will include in my future webpage.

### Choosing A Tool

Reaching the tool selection portion of the Freedom Project, I made a list of the desirable ones I wanted to use. As for choosing a specific tool to find out which one fitted me the most, I had to tinker along with them. The top three tools I chose were: A-Frame, Skeleton, and SASS.

I started with SASS first. For the tool, I tinkered in a [coding game](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/166/sass). The page included to-be completed assignments with instructions provided, as well as having the option to create own examples given the code boxes. As for my part, I first started with the given assignments. I read the instructions and after a while, I managed to complete all of the tasks. I then moved on to my own part of creating examples.
