# SEP10 Freedom Project
By Joe Zheng

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Travel**.

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-Frame** in order to help me make by website.

NOTE: Although I studied individually, I worked alongside Jimmy during this project, making it a co-op. Jimmy also learned his tools seperately as well, but when in the constructing process, we cooperated with each other, and merged our work.
